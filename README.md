# Flow in the U-bend
The repository contains an OpenFOAM case (U-bend_0) dedicated to perform CFD simulations of air flow in a U-shaped ventilation duct and scripts written in Python 2.7 (run_calculations) supposed to automate calculations and investigate the point of flow separation from an inner wall of the U-bend.
